# Neovim Config

This is my personal [Neovim](https://neovim.io) config, pushed to a repo so that I can download it across devices, and made public in the off chance it helps out anybody tripping over the same roadblocks as me.

The guide is based very loosely off of the ["0 to LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) guide by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) on YouTube, so feel free to get started with the setup there.
